HIDKit
======

An Objective-C wrapper around OS X's HID Manager API.

Currently, this is a work in progress and the code is untested. There is no license, although I'm
leaning toward the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ "Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License").

Feel free to download and try it. Pull requests are welcome.
